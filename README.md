# Web Home Automation Remote
Web app for controlling different protocol based home devices in one place.

I am a hobby programmer, who learnt to write this project from a scratch. Half a year ago I did not know either what Raspberry Pi or Git is. Neither did I know JavaScript syntax at all as I had built my last (and only, laying WordPress experiments aside) website when there were still dinosaurs on Earth and HTML4 entered the scene on a white horse back in 1997. Therefore the project is nothing close to a clean code, it is just the result of my how-to-code learning curve steepening.
